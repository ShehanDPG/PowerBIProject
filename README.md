## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Their Usage:

### Sales Amount (Sum of SalesAmount)
* **Usage:** This is a primary financial KPI measuring revenue.
    * **"Sum of SalesAmount by SubCategory" (Top-Left):** Shows the total sales broken down by product sub-categories (e.g., Road Bikes, Touring Bikes, Mountain Bikes). This helps identify which product sub-categories are performing best in terms of revenue.
    * **"Sum of Sales Amount by Order Date" (Bottom-Left):** Displays the trend of total sales over time (monthly, from Jan 2014 to the end of 2016/early 2017). This helps in understanding sales patterns, seasonality, and identifying periods of high or low sales.
    * **"Sum of total" (Middle-Right, 74.62M):** This likely represents the overall total sales amount for the selected filters (currently "Australia" and potentially all years). It provides a quick glance at the grand total revenue.

### Order Quantity (Sum of OrderQuantity)
* **Usage:** This KPI measures the volume of products sold.
    * **"Sum of OrderQuantity" (Middle-Right, 99K):** Shows the total number of items ordered. This is a crucial metric for understanding sales volume and demand.

### Unit Price by Order Quantity (Sum of UnitPrice by OrderQuantity)
* **Usage:** This KPI, displayed as a bar chart with percentages, seems to show the distribution of sales based on the quantity of items in an order.
    * **"Sum of UnitPrice by OrderQuantity" (Top-Middle):** It indicates that a significant portion (56.88%) of the "Sum of UnitPrice" (which might be a proxy for total sales value or revenue) comes from orders with 1 unit. This can highlight common order sizes and potentially inform pricing strategies or inventory management. For example, if most sales are single-unit purchases, it might suggest different marketing approaches compared to bulk purchases.
